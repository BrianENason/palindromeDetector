# palindromeDetector
A short program to detect if the user input is a palindrome

This works on the principle that a palindrome can be a word or phrase that can contain special characters and numbers and still be considered a palindrome. It is set to ignore the basic special character inputs as well as the null/blank inputs. 

Future-proofing could be to ensure all special characters can be ignored.

Make sure to set the "testRun" variable to False if you want to enter your own palindromes
